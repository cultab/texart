# fontfile options

- font file location also include current dir?
- width and rune name -> 1 token followed by letter
- line starting with option area options

# parsing

- make error_msg function
- also distinguish between error and info messages

# flags

- -v --verbose flag? to enable parsing info messages even if not compiled as such?

# makefile

- is it sane?
